Over the past couple of years I've gone back and forth about what I want to host at kylekwiedacz.com.

I've tried to host a wordpress site, too old and slow.

I gave Ghost a try, but didn't want to host it myself, so too expensive and limited in feature set for the cheapest plan.

Hence I've landed on creating a custom site that allows me to experiment some more and leaves room for customization as I want to share various types of content on here, and using the other tools available out there they kept me limited in how I wanted to share certain things.

Here I plan on sharing interesting things I've learned, things are on my mind, things I am working on, and having a place to share my photos.

Hope someone will find this useful, and if you're interested in how I built this site, I have made the source code open to all on my github.
